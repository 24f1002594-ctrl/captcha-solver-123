# Captcha Solver FrontendApp This is a simple, single-page responsive HTML application designed to display captcha images and allow user input for solving them. It is built using plain HTML, JavaScript, and styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern and clean look. ## Features - **Responsive Design**: Adapts gracefully to various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop. - **Tailwind CSS**: Utilizes utility-first CSS for rapid styling and maintainability. - **Image Loading**: - Defaults to loading `sample.png` if no URL parameter is provided. - Can load captcha images from a URL specified in the query string (e.g., `index.html?url=https://example.com/some_captcha.png`). - **Basic Client-Side Validation**: - For the default `sample.png` image, it validates against the hardcoded answer "ADORS". - For images loaded via URL, it provides a placeholder message indicating that client-side validation for arbitrary images is not supported and would require a backend. ## Usage To use this application: 1.  **Open `index.html`**: Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. 2.  **Default Captcha**: The `sample.png` image will be displayed by default. Enter "ADORS" into the input field and click "Submit" to see the correct validation message. 3.  **Load Custom Captcha**: To load a different image, append a `?url=` query parameter to the URL in your browser's address bar. For example: `file:///path/to/your/index.html?url=https://example.com/path/to/your/image.png` (replace `file:///path/to/your/` with the actual path to your `index.html` file and `https://example.com/...` with your desired image URL). ## Technologies - HTML5 - Tailwind CSS (via CDN) - JavaScript ## Development This is a self-contained single HTML file. No build steps or complex environments are required. Just open `index.html` in a modern web browser. ## Contributing Feel free to fork, modify, and improve this simple application.
